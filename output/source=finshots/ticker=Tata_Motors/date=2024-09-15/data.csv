In today‚Äôs Finshots, we tell you why everyone‚Äôs been buzzing about a potential IPO of Tata Sons.
Also, a quick side note. If you're someone who has great communication skills and are looking to join a dynamic team, Ditto is recruiting new Insurance Advisors. You don't even have to know much about Insurance-- We will train you from scratch and you can enjoy working remotely with a great team. Click here to apply.
The Story
For the uninitiated, Tata Sons is what you‚Äôd call a Holding Company. Think of it as the parent to the Tata Group of companies. It owns a sizeable stake of around 30% in these group companies‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsuch as Titan, Tata Motors, and Indian Hotels. These companies can use the Tata surname for the company or the brand if they wish to as long as they follow the ethics and principles of the Tata Group. And then the parent lets them run their own business independently without interference.
When these 29 listed Tata companies and others in its stable make money, they share their profits with the parent. They might send it via dividends. For instance, 95% of ‚Çπ35,000 crores of its revenue in FY23 came from these dividends and a significant portion of it came from its biggest cash cow TCS.
Once the dividend hits its bank account, Tata Sons can use it for whatever it pleases. It used it for the acquisition of Air India. And it pumped thousands of crores into Tata Motors a few years ago when the automaker was struggling.
So yeah, the end use of the money is entirely up to the parent.
Now, a company might resort to an IPO primarily for 3 key reasons‚Ää‚Äî
The owners or investors of the company want to sell a sizeable stake and make some money.
It wants to raise fresh money to expand the business and build new manufacturing units.
It wants to pay off the debt it has accumulated and clean up the accounts.
But Tata Sons does not tick any of these boxes.
For starters, 66% of its shares are owned by Tata-related Trusts that do charity work. They conduct their philanthropy with the money they get from Tata Sons so they won‚Äôt really want to sell their shares. Sure, you could say that the Mistry family who also owns part of the company might want to cash out. But they‚Äôve been waiting for that for a few years now and Tata does not seem to be in a hurry to show them the exit.
Also, Tata Sons has plenty of dividend clinking in its coffers. Not only did that help pare down existing debt but there‚Äôs enough to even pump into expanding capacity in its group companies.
On the face of it, it does not seem like Tata Sons should be in a tearing hurry to launch an IPO.
So, why has it been all over the news then, you ask?
Ah, that‚Äôs thanks to the RBI.
See, the central bank has a rule. If a holding company provides financial support to its group companies, especially by using ‚Äúpublic money‚Äù or money that‚Äôs borrowed from banks, then it will be called a Core Investment Company (CIC).
And since Tata Sons fits the bill, the RBI classified it as a CIC. And also, labelled it as an ‚Äòupper layer‚Äô non-banking financial company (NBFC). This meant it was a crucial player in India‚Äôs lending ecosystem.
However, the problem with this classification was that it came with another caveat. A big one. Tata Sons would have to be publicly listed on the stock exchange by September 2025.
And you can imagine that Tata Sons wasn‚Äôt quite pleased with that diktat. It‚Äôs a private company. Which means that it gets to keep its affairs to itself. And it‚Äôs only responsible to its limited set of shareholders. But going public would increase scrutiny of its actions. It may not have a free hand in making business decisions either.
Now the rumour is that it tried to sway the RBI. Get an exemption to conduct affairs its own way. But unfortunately for Tata Sons, the RBI wasn‚Äôt having any of that. The Tata name didn‚Äôt matter in its books.
Tata would have to follow the rules and go the IPO route.
Now, all of this was a known fact even a few months ago. So it doesn‚Äôt really answer the question as to why there‚Äôs a buzz today, no?
Well, today‚Äôs hype is because a financial services firm Spark Capital released a note about Tata Sons. The analysts crunched the numbers and said by virtue of Tata Sons‚Äô investments in all these listed companies, its value should be a whopping ‚Çπ8 lakh crores at least!
And it could potentially end up being the biggest IPO in India.
But that‚Äôs not what got people talking about Tata Sons.
The thing is, and this is quite weird‚Ä¶some listed Tata stocks own a stake in the parent company too!
Yup, Tata Chemicals owns 3% of its parent. So investors were just excited about the prospect of the amount of money Tata Chemicals could make when this ‚Äòlocked capital‚Äô would become free. And by ‚Äòlocked‚Äô capital, we mean that the company has held this stake for at least 25 years, and it hasn‚Äôt been able to make use of it. Investors never gave it any value because no one knew if the stake would be monetised. But if Tata Sons launched an IPO, Tata Chemicals could finally sell its stake and pocket the gains. It would be massive.
And that‚Äôs why the Tata Chemicals stock price soared by over 30% last week. It was a feeding frenzy.
But not so fast now.
Remember we told you that Tata Sons wouldn‚Äôt prefer a situation where it‚Äôs a publicly listed company, right? That it would like to remain private.
Well, looks like it will do everything in its power to maintain that status quo. Over the weekend, the news flipped on its head. And it now appears that Tata Sons is trying to find a workaround to the RBI diktat. It‚Äôs attempting to shed its CIC and upper-layer NBFC tag!
How‚Äôs it going to do that, you ask?
Well, the RBI rules do grant some leeway. If Tata Sons can repay all of its borrowings. And if it can shunt off its financial services firm Tata Capital into another subsidiary, that could solve its problems. At least that‚Äôs the word on the street.
Now we don‚Äôt know what will eventually happen. Rumours about a Tata Sons IPO have been doing the rounds for nearly two decades now. But each time, it fizzles out. And just like that, even the Tata Chemicals stock has lost its fizz‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit crashed by 10% yesterday.
So maybe it‚Äôs prudent to wait for the Tata Group to make an official announcement the next time at least?
Until then‚Ä¶

Why you MUST buy a term plan in your 20s üëáüèΩ
The biggest mistake you could make in your 20s is not buying term insurance early. Here's why:
1) Low premiums, forever
The same 1Cr term insurance cover will cost you far less at 25 years than at 35 years. And once these premiums are locked in, they remain the same throughout the term!
So if you‚Äôre planning on building a robust financial plan, consider buying term insurance as early as you can.
2) You might not realize that you still have dependents in your 20s
Maybe your parents are about to retire in the next few years and funding your studies didn't allow them to grow their investments‚Äî making you their sole bread earner once they age.
And although no amount of money can replace you, it sure can give that added financial support in your absence.
3) Tax saver benefit
Section 80C of the Income Tax Act helps you cut down your taxable income by the premiums paid. And what's better than saving taxes from early on in your career?
So maybe, it's time for you to buy yourself a term plan. And if you need any help on that front, just talk to our IRDAI-certified advisors at Ditto.

1,Does Tata ‚Äòown‚Äô Jamshedpur?,https://finshots.in/archive/does-tata-own-jamshedpur/,"Does Tata ‚Äòown‚Äô Jamshedpur?
Happy New Year everyone! We hope you and your loved ones have a fantastic 2024 filled with joy and good health.
In the first Finshots edition of the new year, we‚Äôll tell you the story of how Tata might once again take the keys to the city of Jamshedpur and the concept of ‚Äòcompany towns‚Äô.
But before we begin, if you're someone who loves to keep tabs on what's happening in the world of business and finance, then hit subscribe if you haven't already. We strip stories off the jargon and deliver crisp financial insights straight to your inbox. Just one mail every morning. Promise!
If you‚Äôre already a subscriber or you‚Äôre reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story.
The Story
In 1908, the Tatas had an ambitious dream. They wanted to set up India‚Äôs biggest steel companies. And they were out and about looking for a spot to set it all up. They hired a geologist to find the most conducive spot. And he came across a village called Sakchi in the eastern part of the country. It had coal to the north. There was iron ore to its south. And a railway line and the port city of Calcutta (now Kolkata) were in close proximity as well. It was the perfect choice.
So Tata decided this was where its dream would take shape.
The only problem?
It was a village. It didn‚Äôt have big city amenities. No proper roads. No waste disposal mechanisms. No reputed hospitals. Nothing. Why would workers and management even ponder moving here? Even if Tata threw money at them, it wouldn‚Äôt be an exciting proposition.
So Tata decided to do something outrageous. It decided to take matters into its own hands and build a full-fledged town in Sakchi!
Yup, it leased land from the government and got to work. It set up the Tata Town Services to handle the infrastructure needs‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätreating sewage waste and garbage disposal, making roads using plastic, getting electricity in place, and even ensuring security. It began setting up schools and established the Tata Main Hospital (which still exists). It built parks and sports infrastructure.
Basically, Tata did everything that you‚Äôd expect a local government to do for a city. And Sakchi became the first ‚Äòplanned‚Äô city in India. This simply meant that it was something that didn‚Äôt just emerge organically as people migrated and companies were set up, but, it was something built brick by brick with an objective in mind.
But wait‚Ä¶how does Jamshedpur fit into all of this, you ask?
Well, Sakchi* is Jamshedpur. It just took a global war to change the name.
You see, during World War I, Tata supplied a lot of steel at cheap rates to the British Empire. And this steel went into building railways in other parts of the world to help with transporting troops and supplies. In fact, this was so crucial that after the war, a British parliamentary report stated, ‚ÄúIt would have been impossible to carry on the campaign without the iron and steel of India.‚Äù
So as a ‚Äòthank you‚Äô, the British‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwho lorded over India then‚Ää‚Äî‚Äädecided to rename the town after the founder of the Tata Group‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäJamsetji. That is how Sakchi became Jamshedpur.
And for 100 years, Tata ran the show in Jamshedpur. It was the only city with a population greater than 1 million people that functioned without a municipal corporation‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwithout the interference of the local government. Jamshedpur was a ‚Äòcompany town‚Äô.
But in 2018, it hit its first major hurdle.
A group of folks filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) against Tata. The petitioners didn‚Äôt want a ‚Äòprivate‚Äô city. The basic problem was simple‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäTata concentrated its efforts on providing amenities only in the core areas where their employees resided. They didn‚Äôt pay as much attention to the other parts of Jamshedpur. So the development was lopsided. Tata didn‚Äôt seem to care about the ‚Äòoutsiders‚Äô of Jamshedpur. And there wasn‚Äôt any local government body who‚Äôd step up and do the work either.
So Jamshedpur was caught in a limbo.
What was the way out then?
Well, the simplest thing to do would be to hand over the governing rights to a local body. Set up a municipal corporation and make the state government responsible for development. Make it like any other town or city in the country. And that‚Äôs what the Jharkhand government initially decided.
But you can imagine the Tata‚Äôs weren‚Äôt too happy about it. They‚Äôd built the city from scratch nearly 100 years ago. And they didn‚Äôt want to cede control. They said that people trusted the city because of the Tata name‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI mean it was the only city in the state where people could, at one point, drink water straight from their taps too.
So, there had to be an alternative arrangement. And that might be to declare Jamshedpur as an ‚Äòindustrial town‚Äô.
What's that? you ask.
See, there is a special provision under the Indian Constitution to enable a private entity to run a city. There will be a municipal council, but it will include folks from the Tata Group, some government nominees, and locals of the area. This way, Jamshedpur could get the best of both worlds. The residents know that Tata is unlikely to mess up the functioning of a city named after its founder. But, the power to run the city will not be concentrated in the hands of a few. It‚Äôs more democratic since the locals will have a voice. And maybe the outer areas of Jamshedpur won‚Äôt be ignored anymore.
We‚Äôll have to wait and see how it plays out now in what is probably India‚Äôs first and last ‚Äòcompany town‚Äô.
Until then‚Ä¶

Why Millennials Should Buy Term Life Insurance
Nearly 83% of Indian millennials don't have term life insurance!!!
The reason?
Well, some think it's too expensive. Others haven't even heard of it. And the rest fear spam calls and the misselling of insurance products.
But a term policy is crucial for nearly every Indian household. When you buy a term insurance product, you pay a small fee every year to protect your downside.
And in the event of your passing, the insurance company pays out a large sum of money to your family or your loved ones. In fact, if you're young, you can get a policy with 1 Cr+ cover at a nominal premium of just 10k a year.
But who can you trust with buying a term plan?

2,Tata Technologies drives into an IPO,https://finshots.in/markets/tata-technologies-drives-into-an-ipo/,"Tata Technologies drives into an IPO
In today‚Äôs Finshots, we tell you about the long-awaited IPO from the house of Tata that opens on the 22nd of November.
The Story
In the mid-2000s, Ratan Tata had an audacious dream. He wanted to make the world‚Äôs cheapest car. So he called a meeting of 4 engineers from the Tata stable.
But guess what?
Only 1 engineer arrived from Tata Motors. The other 3? They came from Tata Technologies.
Now that seems like quite an odd skew. You‚Äôre making a car and yet you‚Äôre calling folks from a ‚Äòtech‚Äô company. What‚Äôs up with that?
Well, it‚Äôs probably because Tata Technologies had a niche skill. It specialised in something called ER&D. Or Engineering, Research and Development. Its job is to help other car companies design the concept vehicle. It‚Äôll help create the vehicle architecture and engineer the body. It‚Äôll help set up the electrical systems. It‚Äôll help digitise production processes to improve efficiency. And even iron out kinks in customer experience. The whole shebang.
And since the Tata Nano was the first of its kind, maybe the design and engineering skills needed for this were quite different to what a typical automobile expert was used to. Maybe the good folks at Tata Motors couldn‚Äôt do it all. And they needed help if they were going to get the product to market quickly. So Tata Technologies stepped in for the Nano back in the 2000s. Heck, 15 Tata Tech engineers even applied for patents for things they developed for the Nano. And the project was so pivotal for the company that in the words of its CEO, it ‚Äúreally honed our frugal engineering capabilities.‚Äù
But cars of today are very different from the cars of the 2000s. Today, they‚Äôve become software on 4 wheels. And Tata Technologies developed its engineering capabilities to participate in the massive megatrend playing out in the industry‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs called ACE.
Firstly, it involves Connected vehicles that are linked to the internet. It‚Äôs what keeps your infotainment system running smoothly. And helps you download software updates for it over the air. And as per McKinsey, 95% of new vehicles sold in 2030 will be connected to the internet.
Secondly, there are Autonomous cars‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe kind that can automatically help you avoid a head-on collision or alert you when it senses you‚Äôre drowsy. You can imagine that these things require complex lines of code and software to run without a hitch.
Thirdly, there‚Äôs a paradigm shift towards Electric vehicles‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeither due to a personal preference or as in the case of the EU, because of a ban on fossil-fuel-dependent cars by 2035. Now legacy carmakers are embracing this new normal quickly and they need to develop robust battery management systems for EVs and improve charging technology. All through software.
And let‚Äôs just say that Carmakers aren‚Äôt exactly what you‚Äôd call tech experts. They just want to make mechanically and aesthetically pleasing cars that can take us safely from point A to point B. Sure, they could hire a large team, pay them the big bucks, and get them to work on the tech stuff. But heck, carmakers routinely buy even the basic components‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähorns, brake pads, gears from auto ancillary companies. So why should they break their head over all this complex tech, right? It‚Äôs best to leave the tech to the pros.
Tech pros like Tata Technologies. It's riding this ACE wave of outsourcing as companies try to innovate and launch products quicker.
I mean, just look at the electrification programme for Tata Motors‚Äô small sedan Tigor. Now Tata could‚Äôve built the EV from scratch. But that would‚Äôve taken a lot of time and money. Maybe it would‚Äôve needed a new factory too. So it took the help of Tata Technologies. And simply decided to electrify the existing production line. It simply used its existing unused floor space to hand-fit batteries into the bodies of regular fuel vehicles. And guess what? Tata managed to price it below the fabled ‚Çπ10 lakh barrier. Even with all the bells and whistles of the infotainment system. They launched it in quick time too.
It was a massive success story.
Now if you‚Äôve read this far, you might be thinking that Tata Technologies exists just to service the whims and fancies of Tata Motors. So let‚Äôs clear this up. Sure, the company began life as an in-house ER&D provider to the Tata Group. But Tata quickly spun it off into a separate entity. And today, only 35% of its revenues come from the services it offers to the Tata Group. It has struck deals with the biggest carmakers in the world. And it now serves 7 of the top 10 automotive ER&D spenders in the world. Also, just to get closer to the headquarters of these global carmakers, Tata Technologies also has 19 delivery centres across the world‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääincluding the US and Europe.
But wait, isn‚Äôt there another company from the house of Tata that does something similar?
Well, the weird thing is that there is. There‚Äôs Tata Elxsi and it‚Äôs a listed stock too. The only real difference between the two is that Tata Technologies earns 75% of its revenues from the automotive industry. That has been its focus. On the other hand, Tata Elxsi is more diversified‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääonly 45% of its revenues come from the transport sector and the rest of it is split between broadcasting media and healthcare.
So yeah, you could say that if you want to bet on the rapid changes in the car industry, maybe Tata Technologies is where you should be. Now granted, it‚Äôs not a 100% auto-play like another rival KPIT Technologies either‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäTata Technologies provides services to aerospace companies and other transport and heavy machinery companies too. But it‚Äôs still just a small piece of the business and we‚Äôre just comparing the two ‚ÄòTata‚Äô companies in this space now.
So, the question is‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhat‚Äôs the risk in Tata Technologies?
Well, for starters, you‚Äôll see a lot of reports highlighting that the company is heavily dependent on its parent brands‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäTata Motors and Jaguar Land Rover. That 40% of its automotive revenue comes from these anchor clients.
But you could also argue that‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing. After all, the relationship with the parent just means that Tata Technologies is assured of a certain business coming their way.
Also, one connected argument is that if the automotive sector slows down, and if car sales fall flat, it‚Äôs going to be a problem for Tata Technologies. But let‚Äôs just use its rival KPIT Tech to make a point here. See, between 2010 and 2018, the sales of the top 20 carmakers around the world only grew by 6% annually. But, KPIT‚Äôs revenues soared by 22% (in US dollars). So even if cars weren‚Äôt selling like hotcakes, the manufacturers weren‚Äôt hesitating to outsource development and keep up with the tech curve. You could say that Tata Technologies could end up in a similar position too. Provided they can bag projects, of course.
Another niggling worry is that most of the ER&D spending comes from the top 20 automakers in the world. They‚Äôre the ones trying to innovate. So you could wonder if the pool of potential customers for Tata Technologies is limited in this way. And its many rivals are competing for projects from this same pool as well.
But on the flip side, you could argue that the EV space is just about to explode and there‚Äôs going to be plenty of business for everyone. At least that‚Äôs how Tata Technologies‚Äô CEO sees it.
So yeah, there are these risks and the counterarguments too depending on the lens through which you want to view the company.
Rather, investors might be a little more unhappy with the fact that the company actually isn‚Äôt getting fresh money. The ‚Çπ3,000 crores it is ‚Äòraising‚Äô is simply a way for existing investors to get an exit. And that‚Äôs not something that‚Äôll make investors too happy. You typically want companies to use an IPO event to build up the war chest to expand‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbuild new capacity, advertise to drive new business. And you want existing investors to remain as a mark of the growth potential they still see in the company.
But at the end of the day, that‚Äôs just a minor quibble. After all, it‚Äôs an IPO emerging from the house of Tata after 20-long years. And you can bet that‚Äôs enough for a lot of people to hit the ‚ÄúApply‚Äù button. Especially given how their other automotive-linked stocks‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäTata Motors and Tata Elxsi‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähave been racing ahead of late.
Oh, there‚Äôs one more thing. You know how we always complain about IPOs these days being exorbitantly priced? That their valuations are out of whack with reality? Well, we can‚Äôt even say that for Tata Technologies. Let‚Äôs look at the Price-to-earnings (PE) ratio‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich is just how much investors are willing to pay for each rupee of earnings‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbased on FY23 earnings. Tata Technologies is priced at just 32x while its rival Tata Elxsi is trading at over 60x and KPIT Technologies is also at 80x. Now that sounds quite enticing, no?
So yeah, you tell us now‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäWill Tata Technologies see an IPO pop?
Until then‚Ä¶

üö® A simple checklist for picking the best health insurance for you & your loved ones
If you've been thinking of picking a good health insurance plan, then here's a list of things you need to consider.
1) Don‚Äôt split the Bill‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäInsurers might nudge you to consider a co-payment clause, in which case, you‚Äôll be forced to foot a part of the bill each time you make a claim. This might not be the best option unless you have no choice, or are purchasing for elderly citizens.
2) Restrictions on room & room rent‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSome insurers will have a limit on room rent. And if you breach this limit, they‚Äôll make you pay extra for every little service rendered in the room. So opt for a policy that doesn‚Äôt have too many restrictions on this front.
3) Check for Disease Wise Sub-limits‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäIt‚Äôs what happens when the insurer offers you a massive cover for a modest fee, only to include restrictions on coverage for each disease. So make sure you check these sub-limits before making a decision.
4) Seek a Low Waiting Period‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäIf you have pre-existing diseases (including diabetes, blood pressure, etc), you might have to wait a fixed period (typically 2‚Äì4 years) before you‚Äôre covered.
It‚Äôs best to pick a policy where you don‚Äôt have to wait a lot.
5) Coverage for daycare treatments:
Chemotherapy, dialysis, a quick appendectomy- all these procedures might last less than 24 hours. And some insurers might not cover these claims, because they don‚Äôt do ‚Äúdaycare treatments‚Äù. So make sure you check for daycare coverage!

3,Tata vs West Bengal: The Nano Story,https://finshots.in/archive/tata-vs-west-bengal-the-nano-story/,"Tata vs West Bengal: The Nano Story
In today‚Äôs Finshots, we tell you about India‚Äôs land acquisition laws and how the West Bengal Industrial Development Corp. Ltd might finally be forced to cough up ‚Çπ766 crores to Tata Motors.
Before we begin, if you're someone who loves to keep tabs on what's happening in the world of business and finance, then hit subscribe if you haven't already. If you‚Äôre already a subscriber or you‚Äôre reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story.
The Story
In January 2008, Tata stunned everyone at the Delhi Motor Show. They‚Äôd just unveiled the world‚Äôs cheapest car‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe Tata Nano which would be priced at just ‚Çπ1 lakh! It was the first look and everyone wanted to see it. Global media stormed the launch. And they even destroyed the stage in the frenzy.
Yup, the hype was insane. And Tata predicted they‚Äôd soon start churning out 10 lakh Nanos a year. It would be a car revolution.
But where would Tata produce these Nanos?
Well, a couple of years before this event, states had fallen over each other in a bid to woo Tata. Everyone wanted the factory that would roll out the revolutionary car to be built in their region. They could envision the number of jobs and economic progress it could achieve. Finally, West Bengal‚Äôs efforts bore fruit. And Tata decided to set up shop in a place called Singur. The government handed over the needed land. The factory was taking shape. The promise was that the first cars would roll out of the factory by October 2008.
It was touted to be a game-changer for the region. It would help deal with the unemployment issue.
But protests began in full swing. One of the signs said: ‚ÄúAtta not Tata‚Äù.
What was going on, you ask?
Well, the crux of the problem seemed to be that the West Bengal government had forcibly taken 1,000 acres of land from the farmers in the area. Yup, the government hadn‚Äôt owned the land in the first place. And if you‚Äôre wondering about the sign, Atta referred to wheat flour. It was a sign of the farmers saying they wouldn‚Äôt give up fertile farmland for a factory. The Opposition (the political party that wasn‚Äôt in power) created a ruckus too.
Finally, Tata had to abandon a factory that was nearly 85% done. They‚Äôd sunk crores of money into it and it was a doomed enterprise. So they packed up and moved to Sanand in Gujarat instead. West Bengal had lost.
But here‚Äôs the thing.
The entire fiasco was probably the result of the State‚Äôs own doing. Because at the end of the day, it came down to one simple thing - How on earth did the state acquire this land in the first place. You see, India‚Äôs Land Acquisition Law back then was a 19th-century relic*. It was pretty outdated. But, there were a few provisions in the law that had to be satisfied in cases where the state acquired land from the people.
The 3 basic principles were:
Is the forcible acquisition of land by the government for a ‚Äòpublic purpose‚Äô?
Is ‚Äòcompensation‚Äô being paid to those affected?
Is ‚Äòdue procedure‚Äô being followed during acquisition?
Now here‚Äôs the first problem. This definition of ‚Äòpublic purpose‚Äô was quite vague. The government could simply claim that land is going to be used for the greater good of the larger community. And then they‚Äôd simply go ahead. Now you could argue this is fine for instances when land is acquired for say building roads. But, what about when the government acquires land to hand over to a private company whose sole objective is to make profits? Well, the government could still argue that it is ‚Äúlikely to prove useful to the public‚Äù. That it would create jobs and help in development. And that was that.
Sure, they‚Äôd pay compensation. But everyone would squabble over that too. What seemed fair to one wouldn‚Äôt be fair to another. For instance, one report says that in Singur, farmers were paid a premium to the market rate. But when the Nano factory began to take shape, the market rate shot up by 3 times. The farmers felt cheated. They felt that no one in the government was listening to their problems. So the matter went to court. People wanted justice.
And in 2016, two judges of the Supreme Court weighed in on the matter.
Now there might have been a problem here. Because the judges disagreed with each other on whether this particular land acquisition was actually for ‚Äòpublic purpose‚Äô. One said it was done solely in the interest of Tata. The other believed that the public still had some benefit.
But luckily (for the farmers), they did agree on one thing. They said that the government didn‚Äôt follow the third principle‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey ignored ‚Äòdue process‚Äô. See, the ones who give up the land are entitled to a hearing where they can put forward arguments about why their land should not be acquired. They should even be allowed to discuss the fairness of the compensation. But here, apart from an inquiry, the government did nothing else. And this inquiry itself was a ‚Äúfarce and an eyewash‚Äù. The government had already made up its mind and didn‚Äôt care about the farmers.
So yeah, that was enough for the Supreme Court. The judges ordered that the land was to be given back to the rightful owners. And even said that since the farmers had lost access to their land for 10 long years, they didn‚Äôt have to return the compensation they‚Äôd received either. They could keep the monies.
With that, Tata not only lost the factory that it had so painstakingly built. But, it also lost the land it had eventually taken over. Tata trusted the government to do its job right when it came to land acquisition. And let‚Äôs just say the government failed.
What do you think would‚Äôve happened next?
Tata wanted compensation for its troubles. So it challenged the state.
And finally, on 30th October, an arbitration tribunal ruled, ‚ÄúThe West Bengal Industrial Development Corp. Ltd will have to cough up a sum of ‚Çπ766 crores to compensate for the capital investments made by Tata in Singur. Plus they‚Äôd pay interest from 1st September 2016 till the date the final payment is made.‚Äù
So does that mean this is the end of the unhappy chapter in Singur for Tata?
Well, maybe not. The government will probably contest it. And that means more rounds in courts. 17 years later and Tata still can‚Äôt seem to break up with Singur.
Until then‚Ä¶

*Maybe the Singur fiasco was the catalyst, but, the Land Acquisition Act finally got a proper makeover in 2013. The rules were tightened further with rules about acquisition value and getting the approval of 80% of affected parties beforehand.

4,Tata Motors is killing its DVR¬†shares!,https://finshots.in/archive/tata-motors-is-killing-its-dvr-shares/,"Tata Motors is killing its DVR¬†shares!
In today‚Äôs Finshots, we dive into shares with differential voting rights and Tata Motors‚Äô decision to cancel them.
The Story
When a company issues equity shares, they‚Äôre trying to raise money. It could be to make an acquisition. It could be to finance day to day activities. Or companies may do it to repay existing loans and rid themselves of the burden of paying significant amounts of interest periodically. Equity money is pretty much perpetual in nature after all. They don‚Äôt have to ever return it.
But there‚Äôs a slight problem with equity shares. It dilutes ownership.
Say you own 1 out of 10 shares issued by a company. That‚Äôs 10% of the company in your pocket. If the company decides to issue 2 more shares and some third party laps it up, you now own less of the company‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit drops to 8.3%.
And quite often, founders or promoters don‚Äôt like diluting their stake too much. They don‚Äôt like to cede control. Because once someone else owns a share, these folks usually have the right to vote too. The shareholders can choose to actively participate in management decisions. They can band together and scuttle the company‚Äôs plans to diversify or protest against increasing pay.
For instance, back in 2015, shareholders forced Maruti Suzuki to change its agreement with Suzuki Motor Company. The agreement chalked out details about setting up a new plant. Shareholders didn't like it and they voted against the proposal. In another case, shareholders voted to try and prevent Havells from paying a certain royalty to its promoter-owned groups. And a couple of years ago shareholders of Eicher Motors (Royal Enfield) voted against the reappointment of Siddhartha Lal as the MD too.
Yeah, that can happen if promoters give away ownership.
Which brings us to Tata Motors.
In 2008, Tata Motors desperately needed money. It had borrowed this sum to buy British luxury brands, Jaguar and Land Rover. And then it wanted to get rid of the loan. So it decided to tap the equity markets to raise over ‚Çπ4,000 crores and repay the loan.
But the promoters didn‚Äôt want to dilute their ownership. They wanted to keep control. So what did the automaker do?
Well, Tata Motors decided to issue a special kind of share‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsomething called DVR share or differential voting rights share. The premise was simple. It wouldn‚Äôt offer the same voting rights as regular shares. It would carry only 1 vote for every 10 shares. And because it didn‚Äôt carry ‚Äòequal‚Äô rights, Tata Motors would sweeten the deal. The shares would come with an additional dividend. And it would also be issued at a discount to the regular shares. Back then shares of Tata Motors were trading at ‚Çπ340 a pop, but the DVRs were made available at ‚Çπ305.
So investors who didn‚Äôt care about voting rights but only cared about generating passive income through extra dividends swooped in. And Tata Motors raised crores without giving away too much control.
Sounds quite brilliant, no?
So they issued DVRs in 2008. And then some more in 2010 and 2015 too. The promoters raised money and didn‚Äôt have to dilute their own voting power.
And these types of shares have been quite popular in the US. Meta (Facebook), Alphabet (Google) and The New York Times have all issued differential shares or what they call Dual Class Shares (DCS). Heck, when social media firm Snap went public in 2017, all the new shares they issued carried absolutely no voting rights. Which meant only founders and private equity investors would have any say in how the company was run. The IPO still garnered a lot of attention and people flocked to invest.
But unlike the US, DVRs simply never caught on in India. Even though such shares were permitted since December 2000, just a handful of companies issued these shares. And maybe that was a problem. Maybe investors didn‚Äôt really understand what these shares were used for. So while typically these kinds of shares trade at a 5% discount to the main shares, Tata Motors' DVRs were almost always available at a 40‚Äì50% discount.
Now one reason could be that the big investors or the folks like mutual funds preferred to buy ones with voting rights. That way, they could intervene and vote if they felt the company was doing something foolish. And the retail folks simply didn‚Äôt understand what on earth was going on with DVRs. So most of them stayed away. Oh, and Tata Motors didn‚Äôt pay any dividends for a long time either so there was no added benefit here.
So the discount never vanished.
Either way, 15 years after first issuing these DVRs, Tata Motors has had enough. On Monday evening, it announced that it‚Äôs planning to cancel all these DVR shares. Yup, the company‚Äôs DVRs could stop trading within a year.
But here‚Äôs what Tata also did. It looked at the price differential between its two classes of shares‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit was over 40%. And it said, ‚ÄúLook, we know you bought the shares hoping that the price differential would narrow. It hasn‚Äôt. So we want to do something about that. We‚Äôll give you a 20% premium on the share price. We‚Äôll give you 7 regular shares of Tata Motors for every 10 DVR shares you hold. It‚Äôs a sweet deal.‚Äù
Investors are happy.
But also, Tata Motors can smile too.
For starters, they won‚Äôt have the headache of managing two classes of shares now. And they won‚Äôt have to answer questions as to why there‚Äôs always a discount between the two. Also, since everyone will now trade only the main Tata Motors shares, it‚Äôll improve liquidity. People won‚Äôt be confused as to which one to buy.
But it also does something else. A key metric that investors track will improve‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe‚Äôre talking about the earnings per share (EPS).
Why, you wonder?
Think about it this way. Assume a company makes profits of ‚Çπ100. And the company has 10 DVRs and 10 regular shares available for people to buy. In this case, the total number of shares is 20. And the EPS is ‚Çπ5 (‚Çπ100/20).
But now, those DVRs will be exchanged for the regular shares. All 10 of them will disappear and get converted into 7 regular shares. That means the total number of shares will fall to 17. Meanwhile, the profit is still ‚Çπ100. And ergo, the EPS improves to ‚Çπ5.90 and looks optically better.
That could attract more people to invest in Tata Motors. And the demand could push up the stock price too.
So yeah, that‚Äôs all there is to it. And now you know about these Differential Voting Rights shares as well.
The only thing we don‚Äôt know is‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äúwhy now‚Äù. What prompted Tata Motors to act on this out of the blue? And if you have an answer to that, you know where to find us.
Until then‚Ä¶

PS: Just because of this news, investors lapped up the DVR shares of another company Jain Irrigation today. It jumped by 20%! Investors are quite irrational, no?
A message from one of our customers
Nearly 83% of Indian millennials don't have term life insurance!!!
The reason?
Well, some think it's too expensive. Others haven't even heard of it. And the rest fear spam calls and the misselling of insurance products.
But a term policy is crucial for nearly every Indian household. When you buy a term insurance product, you pay a small fee every year to protect your downside.
And in the event of your passing, the insurance company pays out a large sum of money to your family or your loved ones. In fact, if you're young, you can get a policy with 1 Cr+ cover at a nominal premium of just 10k a year.
But who can you trust with buying a term plan?
