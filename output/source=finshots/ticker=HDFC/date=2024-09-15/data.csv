In today's Finshots, we explain why HDFC Bank's share price has fallen by over 10% this week.
The Story
Banks make money in a simple way:
They raise money from the public. It could be via Fixed Deposits or through low-cost Current Accounts and Savings Accounts (CASA).
They then lend money out to people and corporations that need it and charge a high interest rate
The difference between the two eventually gives them their Net Interest Margin (NIM)*.
If the NIM is higher than its rivals, it’s a great sign. It shows that the bank is running its business well and investors will flock towards it.
And for nearly 20 years, there was one bank at the top of this NIM food chain — HDFC Bank. It consistently earned 4% margins. No one else came close.
But right now, HDFC Bank seems to have lost its mojo. Its NIMs have dropped to below 3.5%. It has fallen off the pedestal and investors aren’t happy about it. After it announced its latest quarterly results earlier this week, the stock cracked by over 10%. Domestic investors are selling. Foreign investors are rushing to the exits. Everyone’s spooked.
So, what ails HDFC Bank exactly, you ask?
Well, it's hard to say precisely what wrong. But there are a few theories. The first one could be the merger.
Yup, the $60 billion merger with its housing loan parent company HDFC is still going through some teething troubles. And that could be hurting the combined entity.
We already told you that HDFC Bank had consistently scored a higher NIM than peers for years. A large part of that was thanks to its large base of current accounts where it didn’t have to pay out any interest and the savings accounts which paid out interest at a very low rate.
But then, HDFC Ltd came into the picture.
Since it wasn’t a bank, but a housing finance company, it couldn’t raise CASA deposits. It could only raise the Fixed Deposit kind. These are what you’d term high-cost. The entity had to shell out higher sums of interest on them. Its margins were weaker. Somewhere in the range of 2%-2.5%.
And all of that has landed on HDFC Bank’s table now. In fact, these high-cost borrowings were just 8% of the bank’s liabilities a year ago. But after the merger, they accounted for 21% of HDFC Bank’s liabilities. Just to be clear, a liability for a bank is typically the deposits that they raise and need to pay back.
So you can see how that automatically would’ve compressed margins a fair bit.
Now sure, everyone knew that the merger would have an impact on the bank’s financials. Most analyst reports had felt that the pain would remain for at least a few quarters.
So, if this was an expected result, why would the markets react so harshly?
Well, NDTV Profit believes the answer to that could lie in ‘communication’.
If we rewind to the previous quarter when the bank announced its results, the CFO had said that the margins would improve ‘over a period of time’. The problem now seems to be that investors somehow took that to mean the impact of the merger had been factored into the margins back then. And that it would slowly inch upwards.
Naturally, investors expected higher margins for this quarter. So when the NIMs remained flat, everyone was disappointed. Especially since some of the RBI rules that asked banks to keep aside higher buffers had also eased up.
The other thing here is regarding the growth of deposits. For a bank to be able to lend out money freely, they first need to raise deposits. If deposit growth is slower, it could impact its lending activities and ergo, the ability to make money as well.
And in October 2023, the bank’s CEO said: “So we are very sanguine and very confident that funding [deposits] is never going to be an issue.”
But cut to today and deposit growth has slowed down significantly. In fact to maintain a semblance of balance, it needs deposits to grow 3–4% faster than the credit growth. Since that’s not happening now, it could put some stress on the very ‘funding’ factor that the bank only recently pointed out would never be a problem.
So yeah, you can see why the stock cracked after its results were announced.
And this brings us to the question on everyone’s mind now — Is the HDFC story over?
Well, we doubt it.
For starters, let’s look at the growth in their market share over the years. Since FY15 the bank has doubled its share of Loans and Deposits in the industry — from roughly 5% to above 10% today. That is what made it the behemoth it is today.
But hold on, this doesn’t tell us what the future holds. For that, we need to look at the opportunity too. And as per a report by Banyan Tree Advisors, PSU Banks still hold around 65% of total deposits (short and long-term included). So just by that measure, the runway for growth for someone of HDFC’s pedigree is still long.
And HDFC could be well aware of this. They’ve doubled down on setting up branches all across India. In the past 5 years, the number of branches has risen by 60%. No other bank is launching new branches at this scale. They’re not even close.
Now here’s how this could play out — apparently, there’s a strong correlation between the age of HDFC Bank’s branches and the deposits they manage. There’s an inflection point or what’s called a J-Curve when a branch completes 10 years. The deposits suddenly take off. It’s something that research house Nomura pointed out as well.
But why does that happen?
We can’t be too sure but the common theory is that people prefer the status quo in banking. And it typically takes a bit of time for a branch to make inroads among the population. But once that trust builds, the surge in deposits can be like a tsunami.
Right now, HDFC Bank has over 2,000 branches that are in the 5–10 year vintage. The bet is that the J-curve kicks in soon enough for many of them.
Finally, don’t forget that one key opportunity is that 70% of HDFC Ltd’s customers don’t seem to bank with HDFC Bank. That itself provides a huge opportunity for the bank.
So, is this the right time to snag this beaten-down banking giant?
Unfortunately, we don’t dole out investment advice. But what we can tell you is that despite 5 years of underperforming the Nifty50 index, it still isn’t a cheap stock by any stretch of the imagination. It’ll still require a brave person to bet on HDFC Bank today even with the long-term opportunities that seem to be lying in wait.
So, what do you think about HDFC Bank's prospects?
Until then…
*NIM also includes income from other sources — say bonds the bank has invested in. And it is expressed as a percentage of the average assets that are used to make money.

1,"45 years later, HDFC bids goodbye to Dalal Street",https://finshots.in/archive/45-years-later-hdfc-bids-goodbye-to-dalal-street/,"45 years later, HDFC bids goodbye to Dalal Street
On 12th July at 3:30 pm, the stock ticker HDFC flashed on the trading screens for one final time. After over four decades India’s first dedicated housing finance company had stopped trading on the stock exchanges.
Now we already wrote a story last year about why HDFC Ltd was merging with HDFC Bank and the implications of that. So we won’t get into that again. Rather, in today’s Finshots, we thought we’d rewind the clock a bit and see how the entity became a housing finance behemoth.
And just to be clear, this is not a paid post. We don’t do those here at Finshots. 🙂
The Story
The year was 1977. Hasmukh Thakordas Parekh or HT Parekh or Hasmukhbhai had just hung up his boots after a long banking journey. He’d begun shortly after India’s independence and now he was in his 60s, at an age where most people would want to just put their feet up and relax. Enjoy a much-deserved break.
But not HT Parekh. He wanted a new challenge.
Yup, the man who had been instrumental in setting up and shaping a development finance institution in the country — the Industrial Credit & Investment Corporation of India Limited (ICICI) — wanted to do more.
But what could he do?
He’d already succeeded in making long-term infrastructure financing easier in India. So it had to be something for the regular folks. People like you and me. Or rather, for our grandparents.
And that’s when he hit upon a brainwave — housing. Not building properties, of course. But helping people buy their dream homes.
You see, the 70s were very different. If people wanted to build their own homes, they waited until retirement. They saved every penny. They were prudent with their spending. And they broke their provident fund. That’s how they built homes back in the day. Borrowing to build homes was a foreign concept.
So Mr Parekh set up the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC). He wanted Indians to dream bigger. Get them to believe that taking a loan to create a roof over their heads wasn’t a bad thing. And he had to first change people’s mindsets.
That began with a certain D. B. Remedios. HDFC convinced him to take out a loan of ₹35,000 to build his ₹70,000 home in Mumbai. He was the first official HDFC Ltd customer and the brand’s journey had begun.
The following year, the company decided to tap the public market too. Raise capital from the people. But there wasn’t a big culture of stock market investing either. The brand wasn’t that well known yet. So in 1978, when HDFC launched its IPO, the issue was undersubscribed. People stayed away. And the stock didn’t pop on the day of listing either. It dropped.
Yeah, it wasn’t quite the start anyone would want. But HDFC didn’t stutter
It was building a team that would form its backbone for a long long time. We’re talking about the trio that would go on to become lifers at HDFC Ltd.
First, there was HT Parekh’s nephew, Deepak Parekh. At the age of 33, he left his cushy job at Chase Manhattan Bank and came back to Mumbai at a 50% pay cut. Maybe he felt the familial pull. So he took up the role of Deputy General Manager in 1978 to build the housing finance business. But when India opened up the banking industry to the private sector in the early 1990s, it was Deepak Parekh who convinced the board that HDFC needed to set up a bank. Try and cater to the burgeoning aspiration of young India by offering them personal loans and car loans too. He promised them independent and professional management and he roped in Aditya Puri from Citibank, Malaysia to lead the show.
Then there was Renu Sud Karnad who was a bright-eyed 26-year-old in 1978. She pioneered a hub-and-spoke model for HDFC. Instead of setting up branches in smaller towns that would increase costs, she first appointed 1–2 people to serve as the face of HDFC. It would be a hub-and-spoke model. And the first such hub was launched in the city of Kanpur. The role of the HDFC spoke was “to make sure the customer felt he was wanted and was being heard.” That ethos stayed with HDFC Ltd through its entire lifetime.
And finally, there was Keki Mistry who in 1981 had just got out of a job at the Taj Hotel. He didn’t want to live in Goa and was looking for a new opportunity in the city of Mumbai. He turned down a lucrative Citibank offer because he didn’t want to be just another cog in the wheel of an organization. And instead, he joined the finance department of the fledgling HDFC Ltd. Apparently, Mistry was also the driving force behind HDFC’s multiple financial services bets — insurance and mutual funds. For instance, in 1995, Mistry met a few of the folks from a UK-based insurer. And when they asked him about what was next for HDFC, Mistry simply said “We will look at insurance”. There was no clear plan by then. But soon after, Standard Life reached out and proposed a joint venture. HDFC Standard Life was born.
So yeah, whether it was the business smarts of this A-team or simply a matter of luck favouring the brave, within a few years, the housing lender’s fortunes were on the right track. The annual loan approvals soon breached the ₹100 crore mark. And HDFC was becoming synonymous with home loans.
Meanwhile, with his team in place, HT Parekh decided he wanted another challenge.
So in 1986, he set up another housing finance company. Yeah, he wanted another challenge. But this time, he wanted to help folks in small villages and towns. It was called Gujarat Rural Housing Finance Corporation Limited (GRUH). And it became India’s first specialized rural housing finance company entity for the underserved and informal sector. It was still pretty much part of the HDFC family.
So yeah, these days when you hear techies talking about “Building for Bharat”, HT Parekh actually did that. Or rather, HDFC Ltd did that.
Anyway, with that, HDFC Ltd revolutionized how India borrowed to build a home. They catered to the middle class. And they catered to the rural folks. The business boomed. And even though competition mushroomed over the years, the HDFC brand name attracted potential borrowers. In FY21, HDFC had a 31% market share in housing loans. The only one ahead of it was the State Bank of India.
And by the time HDFC Ltd has to bid adieu to Dalal Street, the company was doing over ₹60,000 crores in revenue and managed over ₹7 lakh crore worth of assets.
Investors were happy too. The share price inched upwards. And even if someone had missed the initial bus, they’d have been alright. If on the first day of the new millennium i.e 1st January 2000, they’d parked ₹1,00,000 in the HDFC Ltd stock, they would’ve been sitting on a pretty pile worth over ₹1 crore by the time 12th July rolled around (not accounting for any dividends paid out).
But that’s where the story kind of ends for HDFC Ltd. Loyal shareholders will see a change in name in their account statements soon enough. Because for every 25 shares of HDFC, they’ll now have 42 shares of HDFC Bank. And India’s first organized home loan provider has quietly merged with its banking counterpart.
And the trio who had reached the pinnacle — Deepak Parekh, the chairman and Keki Mistry, the CEO and Renu Sud Karnad, the Managing Director — will all hang up their boots.
Now as HDFC Bank takes over the mantle to continue the home loan legacy, the folks here will do well to keep these words from Deepak Parekh’s resignation letter in mind.
“Our experience has taught us that every home loan customer has their own story and it is the empathy factor that is the key differentiator between housing finance providers. Dealing with home loan customers requires immense patience. It is about understanding the needs and feelings of a home loan customer, assuaging their anxiety during this complex transaction, customising solutions, explaining financial implications of a mortgage product and lending responsibly to ensure a customer is not over stretched.”
Until then…goodbye HDFC Ltd.

A message from one of our customers
Nearly 83% of Indian millennials don't have term life insurance!!!
The reason?
Well, some think it's too expensive. Others haven't even heard of it. And the rest fear spam calls and the misselling of insurance products.
But a term policy is crucial for nearly every Indian household. When you buy a term insurance product, you pay a small fee every year to protect your downside.
And in the event of your passing, the insurance company pays out a large sum of money to your family or your loved ones. In fact, if you're young, you can get a policy with 1 Cr+ cover at a nominal premium of just 10k a year.
But who can you trust with buying a term plan?
Well, Abhay - the gentleman who left the above review- spoke to Ditto.

2,"HDFC bids farewell to its ₹10,000 crore education loan company",https://finshots.in/archive/hdfc-bids-farewell-to-its-10-000-crore-education-loan-company/,"HDFC bids farewell to its ₹10,000 crore education loan company
In today’s Finshots, we explain why international private equity firms are interested in the Indian education loan business.
The Story
Imagine going to a bank in 2005 and trying to fund your education. Your best bet was to visit a public sector bank and appeal your case. Explain to the manager and the bank why you need to borrow money. They’d evaluate your care objectively for the most part. They’d seek supporting documents and sanction a loan almost immediately if the sum wasn’t substantial. Only large loans called for a guarantee. Banks ruled this space.
Until Ajay Bohora emerged onto the scene.
Now according to BQPrime, the story goes something like this — Bohora was at a conference in the US in 2005 and people here couldn’t stop talking about the private student loan market. The opportunity in the US was massive. It ran into hundreds of billions of dollars. And Bohora thought, “Well, we have over a billion Indians. The opportunity just seems bigger back home.”
So he got his brother onboard and began laying the groundwork. They realized that banks weren’t getting a lot of things right. They were just doling out loans to everyone with little due diligence. And they knew this would bite them back someday. The brothers wanted to be on the scene when this happened. And they wanted to build a more robust business that could leverage this opportunity. So, Credila Financial Services was born in 2006.
But they didn’t want to go on this mission alone. They wanted a partner. They got DSP Merrill Lynch on board the very next year. But the partnership didn’t last long. Why?
Well, because in 2008, we witnessed the global financial crisis and banks such as Merrill Lynch collapsed. That’s when HDFC saw an opportunity. It had made a name for itself by starting off as a dedicated home loan player. So why not buy another financial services company that focused just on education loans?
It made sense. So HDFC jumped in and bought out the stake. It valued Credila at ₹50 crores. And slowly but surely, the bank kept increasing its ownership until it turned full owner in 2019.
The Bohoras exited.
But HDFC couldn’t really enjoy its stint as the full owner for long. Because last year, the housing finance company decided to merge itself with its banking counterpart HDFC Bank. While approving the merger, the Reserve Bank of India asked HDFC to pare its stake in the education loan business. The ultimatum was to sell at least 90% of the business within 2 years.
So HDFC put out some feelers. Asked if anyone was interested. And the suitors lined up. Everyone wanted a piece of the Indian education loan behemoth.
And a couple of days ago, the winners finally emerged — a consortium of private equity players BPEA EQT and ChrysCapital. They’re taking Credila off of HDFC’s hands and valuing the company at over ₹10,000 crores. That makes the education loan company a nearly $1.25 billion unicorn.
Now HDFC will be pretty pleased with the outcome. Because if we’re being honest, it was a ‘nice-to-have’ sort of business. It wasn’t really a big money spinner for HDFC. For instance, the brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher noted that only 0.5% of HDFC’s business value could be attributed to Credila. That’s not much at all.
So why are investors falling over each other to buy Credila then, you ask?
For starters, there’s the macro picture.
Just think of this. As of FY21, nearly 40 million Indian students were enrolled in higher education courses across UG, PG, and diploma programmes. But if you look at the Gross Enrolment Ratio — a metric to see what percentage of students are enrolled as compared to the eligible population in the 18–23 age group — you’ll see a pretty low figure of 29%. For context, it’s 58% in China and 88% in the US.
Now we can hope that as disposable income rises in the country, the ambition of young India soars alongside it. The bet is that we’ll see Gross Enrolment Ratios trend upward too. And when it does, millions of students will need to borrow money to realize their dreams.
Also, Indian students are increasingly flocking overseas. We have nearly 800,000 students studying abroad. And according to some estimates. this figure is expected to double over the next couple of years.
So, financial service firms who dole out education loans could benefit too. And it’s no wonder then that we’ve seen a proliferation of digital-first loan providers of late — such as Leap Finance backed by Sequoia (now Peak XV Partners) and Eduvanz backed by Tiger Global Management.
Then there’s the micro picture.
As we have noted, banks have made quite a hash of the education loan business. Nearly 7–8% of these loans turn bad. So they’ve grown wary and they’re actually dialling back on education loans
This has created an opportunity for the likes of HDFC Credila. These folks currently command nearly half of all education loans doled out by the non-banking channel. And that’s saying something. Also, the kicker is that HDFC Credila has done a pretty decent job at controlling defaults. Their bad loans are at a puny 0.12%. Despite the fact that nearly 75% of their education loans don’t have any collateral backing it. And they’re also digitizing their operations to keep up with new-age competition.
So yeah, you can see why private equity investors would be quite interested in India’s first pure-play education loan firm even now. It’s a proven model, unlike the other startups in the space. And they’ll still get the might of the HDFC group which will continue to hold a 10% stake in the company. They’re keeping their skin in the game. And that itself is a great indicator of what the future could hold for the company, no?
Until then…

The Story
30 years ago, a bright-eyed young man stumbled his way into a world that not many knew even existed — equity research. The industry was so raw. It was so new that only a handful of mutual fund companies even operated a full-fledged equity research desk. And the young man became only the second member of a very new team at SBI Mutual Fund.
But little did everyone know that they’d be singing his praises soon enough. Little did they know he’d become one of India’s longest-serving mutual fund managers. People speak so highly of Peter Lynch’s performance — about how he delivered over 29% annual returns in the 13 years he ran the famous Fidelity Magellan Fund. But Prashant Jain's performance is equal to it. His incredible 20%+ returns in the past couple of decades could rival any fund manager’s performance.
So when Jain penned a farewell message a couple weeks back, we knew we had to parse through it and summarise it for you.
Being in the right place at the right time matters
Sometimes, you could do everything right, make the right investment decisions, avoid the losers, be patient, everything that the experts tell you to do, but still, come out with nought.
You need to be lucky as well.
What do we mean?
Okay, let’s look at the US first.
Imagine that you’d started making money in the 1950s and you decided to set aside some of this in stocks. You picked out S&P 500 index to invest in (it’s a hypothetical scenario since there weren’t really index funds back then). You sat back and watched the market do nothing for the next 20 years after adjusting for inflation.
But if you’d started your investment journey in the 1970s, the next two decades would’ve multiplied your investment by 10 times (again, after inflation).
In some ways, your investing performance would have depended on your birth year. And that’s not something you can control.
What about India, you ask?
Well, if we look at returns from Sensex, we’ll see something similar playing out.
In the 1990s, the benchmark index of 30 stocks generated annual returns of just over 20%.
In the 2000s, the returns dropped to 13%.
And in the 2010s, it had fallen even further to 9%.
In a sense, Prashant Jain spent a large part of his investment career during the heydays. And maybe he wants to reiterate the fact that he too was lucky.
2. Pareto Principle
Now, this isn’t a hard and fast rule. But you can observe the Pareto principle in all walks of life. 20% of your actions drive 80% of your outcomes. The Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto coined the term when he observed that just 20% of people in Italy owned around 80% of all wealth. He even observed the same phenomenon in his backyard — 20% of the pea pods gave 80% of the peas.
The basic theory is that a limited number of actions create outsized results. And it applies to investments too.
For instance, Prashant Jain invested in around 465 stocks during his stint at HDFC. And here’s something that will blow your mind…just 55 stocks contributed to nearly 87% of the total gains!
And again, this isn’t an anomaly or something specific to Prashant Jain’s style of investing.
Let’s take one of the greatest investors of all time, Warren Buffet.
In 2013, he said that over his lifetime he’d owned around 500 stocks. But  only 10 stocks were responsible for most of the big money. So if you removed those stocks from Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio, well, the track record would be pretty average.
In fact, it’s the same sentiment that was echoed by Buffet’s investing guru and father of value investing Benjamin Graham. He attributed his stellar performance to a single stock pick — Geico. He invested 20% of his firm’s money in the company and rode the wave as the stock price zoomed. And even though he preached diversification, he broke his own rules this one time.
The only problem here is — You can never know which stocks will outperform. As Jain wrote himself, “If only one had the wisdom of avoiding 90% of the investments and instead invested in the 55 stocks.”
3. Position sizing is very important…but it’s also not easy
You will not be able to avoid the duds in a portfolio. Period. That’s just the nature of the game. In Prashant Jain’s case, around 1/4 of stocks lost money and 1/100 lost big money.
But the skill is in assessing the risk-reward associated with each investment and placing your bets accordingly. So you could have a winner that gave you 250% returns on your hands, but if you’ve invested only 2% of your money in that  stock, that’s probably not going to move the needle for you in a big way. And all that effort at identifying the stock has gone to waste.
So you have to double down on high-conviction bets and allocate a larger chunk of your money here to make up for the duds.
In Jain’s case, his positioning was pretty much always on point. For every 20 stocks he picked, he had 1 stock that delivered colossal returns. But he took a sizeable position on this one stock, which meant that his overall portfolio gained from his conviction.
Retail investors on the other hand have a tendency to cut their winners too early. Once they buy a stock and it soars in value, they don’t double down on it. They want to cut their position and take home what little gain they make. They use their buying price as an anchor. On the other hand, they hang onto their losers and sometimes pump more money into it because the rupee value has fallen. And it ends up becoming an outright mess.
What truly matters is how much money you make when you get things right and how little you lose when you get things wrong.
So yeah, maybe you’ll keep these lessons in mind when you make your investments the next time around.
Until then…

Ditto Insights: The Married Women’s Protection Act (MWP Act)
Imagine you buy a term insurance policy. A good one at that. One that will adequately cover your spouse and your kids. Say 2 crores all in all. And then one day, tragedy beckons. You pass away leaving your family with boatloads of debt — money that you borrowed in setting up your business. Immediately, the creditors try and stake their claim on the proceeds of the policy. They’ll approach the courts and they’ll take away most of the 2 crores. 2 crores that you wanted to leave for your wife and your family.
Now they are left with very little if anything at all.
But there’s a way to prevent this unfortunate scenario. If you were to buy a term policy under the MWP Act, then nobody can stake claim to the proceeds of your policy except your wife and/or children. The proceeds of the policy go to trust and can only be claimed by trustees (who in this case will be your wife and/or children). The only downside of the MWP Act however is that you can’t change your nominees, once you submit your application.
So yeah, if you’re looking to buy a term policy, always remember that you have an option to buy the policy under the MWP Act.

4,Weekly Wrapup - Understanding the HDFC Merger,https://finshots.in/archive/weekly-wrapup-understanding-the-hdfc-merger/,"Weekly Wrapup - Understanding the HDFC Merger
Before we get to today's story, a quick recap on all the things we covered this week. On Monday we spoke about the end of globalization, next we discussed how Netflix brought F1 to the masses. On Wednesday we talked about India's attempt to ban single-use plastic again, then we discussed Axis Bank-Citi deal, and finally we saw how Europe came to be so dependent on Russian gas.
Alright we that out of the way, let's get to today's big story. It's about the merger between HDFC and HDFC Bank
The Story
“As the son grows older, he acquires the father’s business.”
That’s how Deepak Parekh, the chairman of HDFC Ltd explained the merger between the 45-year old HDFC Ltd and its 28-year old banking offspring HDFC Bank. And you know what? It’s a nice way of summarizing this merger (apart from the gender reference of course).
The point is — You can’t just look at this merger in the here and now. You have to rewind a bit and look at the historical relationship between these two iconic institutions.
So let’s go back to 1977. HDFC Ltd had just set up shop and it had one simple goal — to change people’s behaviour.
Wait, what? Isn’t HDFC the Housing Development Financial Corporation? A non-banking financial institution (NBFC)? What’s this nonsense about behaviour?
Well, 1977 isn’t 2022. If people wanted to build their own homes, they waited until retirement. They saved every penny. They were prudent with their spending. And they broke their provident fund. That’s how they built homes back in the day. Borrowing to build homes — That was a foreign concept. And HDFC wanted to change that.
So they convinced a certain D. B. Remedios to take out a loan of ₹35,000 to build a ₹70,000 home in Mumbai and thus began HDFC’s journey. This was their first customer and within a few years, the lender’s annual loan approvals had already breached the ₹100 crore mark. There was no looking back and HDFC became synonymous with home loans.
But then we had the liberalization reforms in the 1990s. And this paved the way for something even greater.
At the time, public sector banks weren’t exactly the epitome of efficiency. They were weighed down by their legacy and people wanted a fresh banking experience — something more nimble. So HDFC made a pitch for a full-fledged banking license and HDFC Bank emerged as a result. As an added bonus, its chairman Deepak Parekh managed to convince Aditya Puri, who was heading Citibank Malaysia at the time, to jump ship and head the new banking upstart. The stage was set. This was HDFC Bank’s moment to shine.
But they didn’t exactly set the stage on fire the first year. In fact, the performance was quite disappointing. However, in its first annual report, the bank decided to stick to its guns and talk about the company’s four values — operational excellence, customer focus, product leadership, and professional people. It wanted to gain people’s trust.
And the rest, as they say, is history. HDFC bank quickly became India’s second-largest bank and people would automatically assume that the bank would grow 20% every year. It even found a place in the 100 most valuable brands in the world.
The “child” had outdone the “parent”
And finally, after years of speculation, it seems to be happening. The two entities will merge into one and the $60 billion deal is going to create a financial behemoth of epic proportions. With HDFC Ltd’s assets thrown into the mix, HDFC Bank’s market share will jump from 11% to 15%. For context, India’s largest bank SBI has a market share of nearly 26%. This will also mean HDFC Bank will now be 2x the size of its nearest competitor — ICICI Bank.
So, how did it come to this? And why did HDFC Bank finally make an offer that its parent couldn’t refuse?
Frankly, the writing was on the wall.
You see, back in November 2020, an internal group set up by the banking regulator RBI had published a recommendation. It said that large non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) should consider turning into banks.
Why did they make that recommendation? It was pretty simple really. Over the years, the distinction between NBFCs and banks had narrowed. In most cases, both these entities could accept deposits. And both of them could dole out loans.
But regulations favoured NBFCs. They didn’t have to deal with as many restrictions and red tape. They had more leeway and time when it came to classifying bad loans. And this gave NBFCs an undue advantage over banks. Most of them grew at breakneck speeds and prioritized growth above all else. But this also came at a cost. Remember the IL&FS crisis from 2018? The company lent out a lot of money and couldn’t pay its creditors when push came to shove.
And  when IL&FS blew up, everyone feared that the fallout would destroy the NBFC landscape. So the RBI decided to act. They tightened restrictions and put a new regulatory framework. Big NBFCs were now bound by similar regulations — the kind banks had always been dealing with.
So maybe HDFC feels there’s no point running a bank and another almost bank-like institution in parallel.
But there’s also another reason — a hiccup in the “home loans” business.
In a recent press conference Sashidhar Jagdishan, the CEO of HDFC Bank said, and we quote: “The biggest motivation for the deal is creating demand in the housing market as our penetration in this segment is very low. We are losing our customers to other banks.”
See, banks love home loans. It’s the kind of loan that’s safe and sticky. After all, you always have the collateral — an actual home. And more importantly, demand for home loans was on the up. Unfortunately for HDFC Bank, they simply couldn’t participate in this line of business. HDFC was already doing it and so, all they could do was promptly assign (sell) these loans to HDFC and earn a small fee while at it. On the flipside, they could have earned so much more if they did everything themselves.
On the side, HDFC too had its own set of problems. For instance, banks can dole out cheap home loans because they can mobilize funds through deposits. They pay very little interest on your savings account and they can use these funds to then create home loans at a higher interest rate. Now even though HDFC wasn’t a bank, they could still access deposits. However, they couldn’t do it at the scale HDFC Bank was operating. So in effect, while HDFC Bank could mobilize funds at an average interest rate of say 4%, HDFC Ltd was doing it at 6%. That was their cost of borrowing. And naturally, it meant they had to charge prospective customers a higher rate of interest. And with this extra charge, their home loans simply weren’t going to be competitive as other banks — like Kotak Mahindra for instance.
A merger meanwhile solves this problem easy. The combined entity can now access deposits at a significantly lower rate of interest and they could be a real force of nature now.
But wait…we have to talk about the potential problems too, right?
Yes, we must. So let’s start with infrastructure lending then. Remember when we wrote about HDFC and the uncanny way in which they sidestepped the implosion of debt-ridden infrastructure companies in the 2000s?
Yeah, that story.
When HDFC Bank’s Executive Director Paresh Sukhthanka was asked about the company’s relative absence in the Infra space, he said and we quote — “It’s not that we haven’t participated in infrastructure. We have probably had a lower concentration of our loans in infrastructure. I’d say that risk management is also about deciding what you want to do and don’t want to do; be it with infrastructure or others segments and then doing it better… So I don’t think our strategy has been to avoid taking risks. I think we have been taking risks, when we have understood those risks and wanted to take those risks” — Forbes Interview, 2013
However, it seems they’ll probably change this strategy a bit. In fact, the press release says so explicitly: “It will also enable underwriting of larger ticket loans, including infrastructure loans — an urgent need of the country.”
So should investors worry about some of the risks involved? Maybe.
But there’s another problem.
Mergers aren’t always a silver bullet. A lot of mergers fail or they don’t quite work the way the top executives expect. It could be a people problem. It could be a systems problem. It could be a problem of cultures. Things can go wrong. In fact, the former CEO Aditya Puri may have held the notion that a merger may not entirely be fruitful for all parties involved.
So yeah, things could always take a turn for the worse, even when two stellar institutions come to join forces.
But will it actually happen? We will let you decide. What do you think? Will the merger bode well for HDFC Bank or do you think this will just slow them down?
